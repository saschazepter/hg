conversion from largefiles -> lfs.

Setup a repo with a normal file and a largefile, above and below the lfs
threshold to test lfconvert.  *.txt start life as a normal file; *.bin start as
an lfs/largefile.

  $ hg init largefiles

Add an lfs file and normal file that collide with files on the other branch.
large.bin is added as a normal file, and is named as such only to clash with the
largefile on the other branch.

Merge largefiles into lfs branch

The largefiles extension will prompt to use the normal or largefile when merged
into the lfs files.  `hg manifest` will show standins if present.  They aren't,
because largefiles merge doesn't merge content.  If it did, selecting (n)ormal
would convert to lfs on commit, if appropriate.

BUG: Largefiles isn't running the merge tool, like when two lfs files are
merged.  This is probably by design, but it should probably at least prompt if
content should be taken from (l)ocal or (o)ther as well.

When both largefiles and lfs are configured to add by size, the tie goes to
largefiles since it hooks cmdutil.add() and lfs hooks the filelog write in the
commit.  By the time the commit occurs, the tracked file is smaller than the
threshold (assuming it is > 41, so the standins don't become lfs objects).

  $ "$PYTHON" -c 'import sys ; sys.stdout.write("y\n" * 1048576)' > large_by_size.bin
  $ hg --config largefiles.minsize=1 ci -Am 'large by size'
  adding large_by_size.bin as a largefile
  $ hg manifest

  .hglf/lfs.bin
  lfs.txt
  normal.txt

  $ hg rm large_by_size.bin
  $ hg ci -m 'remove large_by_size.bin'

Largefiles doesn't do anything special with diff, so it falls back to diffing
the standins.  Extdiff also is standin based comparison.  Diff and extdiff both
work on the original file for lfs objects.

A largefiles repo can be converted to lfs.  The lfconvert command uses the
convert extension under the hood with --to-normal.  So the --config based
parameters are available, but not --authormap, --branchmap, etc.

  $ cd ..
  $ hg lfconvert --to-normal largefiles nolargefiles 2>&1
  initializing destination nolargefiles
  0 additional largefiles cached

  3 merge largefiles with lfs -> normal
  2 merge largefiles with lfs -> large
  1 large by size

  $ cd nolargefiles

The requirement is added to the destination repo.

No diffs when comparing merge and p1 that kept p1's changes.  Diff of lfs to
largefiles no longer operates in standin files.

This `head -n 20` looks dumb (since we expect no output), but if something
breaks you can get 1048576 lines of +y in the output, which takes a looooooong
time to print.
