Function to test discovery between two repos in both directions, using both the local shortcut
(which is currently not activated by default) and the full remotable protocol:

  $ testdesc() { # revs_a, revs_b, dagdesc
  >     if [ -d foo ]; then rm -rf foo; fi
  >     hg init foo
  >     cd foo
  >     hg debugbuilddag "$3"
  >     hg clone . a $1 --quiet
  >     hg clone . b $2 --quiet
  >     echo
  >     echo "% -- a -> b tree"
  >     hg -R a debugdiscovery b --verbose --old
  >     echo
  >     echo "% -- a -> b set"
  >     hg -R a debugdiscovery b --verbose --debug --config progress.debug=true
  >     echo
  >     echo "% -- a -> b set (tip only)"
  >     hg -R a debugdiscovery b --verbose --debug --config progress.debug=true --rev tip
  >     echo
  >     echo "% -- b -> a tree"
  >     hg -R b debugdiscovery a --verbose --old

Set iteration order could cause wrong and unstable results - fixed in 73cfaa348650:

  searching for changes
  101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110  (no-eol)

The case where all the 'initialsamplesize' samples already were common would
give 'all remote heads known locally' without checking the remaining heads -
fixed in 86c35b7ae300:

Even if the set of revs to discover is restricted, unrelated revs may be
returned as common heads.
