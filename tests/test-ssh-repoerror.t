#require unix-permissions no-root no-windows no-rhg

XXX-RHG this test hangs if `hg` is really `rhg`. This was hidden by the use of
`alias hg=rhg` by run-tests.py. With such alias removed, this test is revealed
buggy. This need to be resolved sooner than later.

repository itself is non-readable
---------------------------------

  $ hg init no-read
  $ hg id ssh://user@dummy/no-read
  000000000000
  $ chmod a-rx no-read

  $ hg id ssh://user@dummy/no-read
  remote: abort: Permission denied: *$TESTTMP/no-read/.hg* (glob)
  abort: no suitable response from remote hg
  [255]

special case files are visible, but unreadable
----------------------------------------------

This is "similar" to the test above, but the directory is "traversable". This
seems an unexpected case in real life, but we test it anyway.

  $ hg init other
  $ hg id ssh://user@dummy/other
  000000000000
  $ for item in `find other | sort -r` ; do
  >     chmod a-r $item
  > done

  $ hg id ssh://user@dummy/other
  remote: abort: Permission denied: '$TESTTMP/other/.hg/requires'
  abort: no suitable response from remote hg
  [255]

directory toward the repository is read only
--------------------------------------------

  $ mkdir deep
  $ hg init deep/nested

  $ hg id ssh://user@dummy/deep/nested
  000000000000

  $ chmod a-rx deep

  $ hg id ssh://user@dummy/deep/nested
  remote: abort: Permission denied: *$TESTTMP/deep/nested/.hg* (glob)
  abort: no suitable response from remote hg
  [255]

repository has wrong requirement
--------------------------------

  $ hg init repo-future
  $ hg id ssh://user@dummy/repo-future
  000000000000
  $ echo flying-car >> repo-future/.hg/requires
  $ hg id ssh://user@dummy/repo-future
  remote: abort: repository requires features unknown to this Mercurial: flying-car
  remote: (see https://mercurial-scm.org/wiki/MissingRequirement for more information)
  abort: no suitable response from remote hg
  [255]
