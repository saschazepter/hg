/// A `Graph` backed up by objects and functions from revlog.c
///
/// This implementation of the `Graph` trait, relies on (pointers to)
/// - the C index object (`index` member)
/// - the `index_get_parents()` function (`parents` member)
///
/// # Safety
///
/// The C index itself is mutable, and this Rust exposition is **not
/// protected by the GIL**, meaning that this construct isn't safe with respect
/// to Python threads.
///
/// All callers of this `Index` must acquire the GIL and must not release it
/// while working.
///
/// # TODO find a solution to make it GIL safe again.
///
/// This is non trivial, and can wait until we have a clearer picture with
/// more Rust Mercurial constructs.
///
/// One possibility would be to a `GILProtectedIndex` wrapper enclosing
/// a `Python<'p>` marker and have it be the one implementing the
/// `Graph` trait, but this would mean the `Graph` implementor would become
/// likely to change between subsequent method invocations of the `hg-core`
/// objects (a serious change of the `hg-core` API):
/// either exposing ways to mutate the `Graph`, or making it a non persistent
/// parameter in the relevant methods that need one.
///
/// Another possibility would be to introduce an abstract lock handle into
/// the core API, that would be tied to `GILGuard` / `Python<'p>`
/// in the case of the `cpython` crate bindings yet could leave room for other
/// mechanisms in other contexts.
