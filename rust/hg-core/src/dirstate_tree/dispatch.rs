/// a trait object of this trait. Except for constructors, this trait defines
/// all APIs that the class needs to interact with its inner dirstate map.
///
/// A trait object is used to support two different concrete types:

/// * `rust/hg-core/src/dirstate/dirstate_map.rs` defines the "flat dirstate

///   fields.
/// * `rust/hg-core/src/dirstate_tree/dirstate_map.rs` defines the "tree
///   dirstate map" based on a tree data struture with nodes for directories
///   containing child nodes for their files and sub-directories. This tree
///   enables a more efficient algorithm for `hg status`, but its details are
///   abstracted in this trait.
