"""Tool read primitive events from a pipe to produce a catapult trace.

Usage:
    Terminal 1: $ catapipe.py /tmp/mypipe /tmp/trace.json
    Terminal 2: $ HGCATAPULTSERVERPIPE=/tmp/mypipe hg root
    <ctrl-c catapipe.py in Terminal 1>
    $ catapult/tracing/bin/trace2html /tmp/trace.json  # produce /tmp/trace.html
    <open trace.html in your browser of choice; the WASD keys are very useful>
    (catapult is located at https://github.com/catapult-project/catapult)

For now the event stream supports

  START $SESSIONID ...

and

  END $SESSIONID ...

events. Everything after the SESSIONID (which must not contain spaces)
is used as a label for the event. Events are timestamped as of when
they arrive in this process and are then used to produce catapult
traces that can be loaded in Chrome's about:tracing utility. It's
important that the event stream *into* this process stay simple,
because we have to emit it from the shell scripts produced by
run-tests.py.

Typically you'll want to place the path to the named pipe in the
HGCATAPULTSERVERPIPE environment variable, which both run-tests and hg
understand. To trace *only* run-tests, use HGTESTCATAPULTSERVERPIPE instead.
