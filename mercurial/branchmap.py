            #   only branchhead as there are no possible ancestors on
            #   the same branch.
            # - If a parent is on the same branch, a branchhead can
            #   only be an ancestor of that parent, if it is parent
            #   itself. Otherwise it would have been removed as ancestor
            #   of that parent before.
            # - Therefore, if all parents are on the same branch, they
            #   can just be removed from the branchhead set.
            # - If one parent is on the same branch and the other is not
            #   and there was exactly one branchhead known, the existing
            #   branchhead can only be an ancestor if it is the parent.
            #   Otherwise it would have been removed as ancestor of
            #   the parent before. The other parent therefore can't have
            #   a branchhead as ancestor.
