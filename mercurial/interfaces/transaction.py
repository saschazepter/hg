# transaction.py - simple journaling scheme for mercurial
#
# This transaction scheme is intended to gracefully handle program
# errors and interruptions. More serious failures like system crashes
# can be recovered with an fsck-like tool. As the whole repository is
# effectively log-structured, this should amount to simply truncating
# anything that isn't referenced in the changelog.
