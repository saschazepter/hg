Exceptional release following a large performance regression when cloning.

of the sort from happening in the future.

 * phases: update the phase set as we go during retract boundary
 * bundle2: make the "hgtagsfnodes" part advisory

Exceptional release following a crash found in delta code that can be triggered
with complex repository shapes.

 * delta-search: fix crash caused by unbound variable
 * sshpeer: fix path when handling invalid url exception
 * subrepo: fix normalizing paths with scheme

== Backwards Compatibility Changes ==

Users of the Rust extensions and/or `rhg` should be aware that the new Rust
index can result in a performance degradation for push/pull on repositories
*not* using `persistent-nodemap` (see `hg help config.format.use-persistent-nodemap`).

If this is something that matters to you, please reach out to us as this is not
an insurmountable obstacle. This is a choice base on the assumption that
there are few people in this situation and our time should be spent on more
pressing matters.
