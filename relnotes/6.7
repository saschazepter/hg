 * debugformat: fix formatting for compression level
 * obsutil: sort metadata before comparing in geteffectflag()
 * crecord: drop calls to `curses.endwin()`
 * rust-index: don't use mutable borrow for head-diff computation
 * rust-index: don't use mutable borrow to computed filtered heads


== Backwards Compatibility Changes ==

Users of the Rust extensions and/or `rhg` should be aware that the new Rust
index can result in a performance degradation for push/pull on repositories
*not* using `persistent-nodemap` (see `hg help config.format.use-persistent-nodemap`).

If this is something that matters to you, please reach out to us as this is not
an insurmountable obstacle. This is a choice base on the assumption that
there are few people in this situation and our time should be spent on more
pressing matters.
