= Mercurial 6.7rc0 =

/!\ These are **tentative** release notes for the upcoming Mercurial 6.7.
Anything can be added or removed before the actual release.

As usual, a *lot* of patches don't make it to this list.

== New Features ==

 * JSON templates can now use structured diffstat data
 * Support rhg status --rev --rev
 * The index for REVLOGv1 now has a Rust implementation
 * Improved `hg censor`'s output
 * censor: add a command flag to skip the head checks
 * censor: accept multiple revision in a single call
 * usage: add a `usage.repository-role` config
 * branchmap: use mmap for faster revbranchcache loading
 * crecord: enable search hotkeys (issue6834)
 * hg-core: separate timestamp and extra methods
 * annotate: limit output to range of lines
 * unbundle: faster computation of changed heads
 * Large improvements of some of the phases code (23950e39281f)

== New Experimental Features ==

 * Introduce `hg admin::chainsaw-update` for automation and *advanced* users

== Bug Fixes ==

 * templatekw: fix inconsistency of diffstat with diff.merge
 * The endless stream of Python 3 cleanups continues
 * Improved setup.py robustness
 * Improved test suite robustness
 * add: don't attempt to add back removed files unless explicitly listed
 * statprof: handle `lineno == None` in more cases
 * rust: fix cargo doc for hg-cpython
 * rust-python-index: don't panic on a corrupted index when calling from Python
 * debugindexstats: handle the lack of Rust support better
 * matchers: use correct method for finding index in vector
 * narrow: strip trailing `/` from manifest dir before matching it
 * cext: fix potential memory leaks of list items appended with PyList_Append
 * doc: document that labels must have a dot in them to have an effect
 * debugformat: fix formatting for compression level

== Backwards Compatibility Changes ==

Users of the Rust extensions and/or `rhg` should be aware that the new Rust
index can result in a performance degradation for push/pull on repositories
*not* using `persistent-nodemap` (see `hg help config.format.use-persistent-nodemap`).

If this is something that matters to you, please reach out to us as this is not
an insurmountable obstacle. This is a choice base on the assumption that
there are few people in this situation and our time should be spent on more
pressing matters.
