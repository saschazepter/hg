== Backwards Compatibility Changes ==

 * This release drops support for Python 3.6 and 3.7.
 * Starting with this release and hopefully for the forseeable future,
   we are now building wheels for most architectures.
   /!\ Note that for Rust users installing via `pip` or `pipx`, you will need
   to specify `--no-binary` to continue using Rust since we do not yet package
   the Rust compilation in our wheels. We plan on fixing this for 7.0.
 * Python 3.13 changed how it handles docstrings (namely removing uniform
   leading whitespace for every line), which forced us to align the
   representation of our help text with this new behavior across all versions.
   Due to this and a lack of time and expertise from contributors, a lot of
   existing translations could be missing. The effort of i18n in general has
   died down many years ago, but if this matters to you, feel free to send
   your contributions. 


== New Features ==

 * exchange: improve computation of relevant markers for large repos
 * Add a Rust fast-path to speed up update (also for `clone`) from null (up to 4x faster) 
 * Introduced a new rev-branch-cache version (v2) that is mmap-resistant

 * Improved the performance of the fix for issue6528
 * clonebundles: allow manifest to specify sha256 digest of bundles
 * merge: improve working-copy mtime race handling

 * merge: add a config to allow conflict-free merge of changes on adjacent lines
