== Bug Fixes  ==


== Backwards Compatibility Changes ==

 * A shell that supports `$(command)`` syntax for command substitution is now
   required for running the test suite. The test runner normally uses
   `sh`, so if that is a shell that doesn't support `$(command)` syntax,
   you can override it by setting `$HGTEST_SHELL` or by passing it to
   `run-tests.py --shell <shell>`.
