== New Features ==
 
 * `hg purge` is now a core command using `--confirm` by default.
 
 * The `rev-branch-cache` is now updated incrementally whenever changesets
   are added.


== New Experimental Features ==

 * `hg diff` now takes an experimental `--merge` flag which causes `hg
    diff --change` to show the changes relative to an automerge for
    merge changesets. This makes it easier to detect and review manual
    changes performed in merge changesets.


== Bug Fixes ==



== Backwards Compatibility Changes ==


== Internal API Changes ==

 * `changelog.branchinfo` is deprecated and will be removed after 5.8.
   It is superseded by `changelogrevision.branchinfo`.
