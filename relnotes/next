== New Features ==


== New Experimental Features ==


== Backwards Compatibility Changes ==

* Mercurial now requires at least Python 2.7.9 or a Python version that
  backported modern SSL/TLS features (as defined in PEP 466), and that Python
  was compiled against a OpenSSL version supporting TLS 1.1 or TLS 1.2
  (likely this requires the OpenSSL version to be at least 1.0.1).


== Internal API Changes ==

 * logcmdutil.diffordiffstat() now takes contexts instead of nodes.

 * The `mergestate` class along with some related methods and constants have
   moved from `mercurial.merge` to a new `mercurial.mergestate` module.
