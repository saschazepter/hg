== New Features ==
 
 * `hg purge` is now a core command using `--confirm` by default.
 
 * The `rev-branch-cache` is now updated incrementally whenever changesets
   are added.


== New Experimental Features ==

 * There's a new `diff.merge` config option to show the changes
    relative to an automerge for merge changesets. This makes it
    easier to detect and review manual changes performed in merge
    changesets. It is supported by `hg diff --change`, `hg log -p`
    `hg incoming -p`, and `hg outgoing -p` so far.


== Bug Fixes ==



== Backwards Compatibility Changes ==


== Internal API Changes ==

 * `changelog.branchinfo` is deprecated and will be removed after 5.8.
   It is superseded by `changelogrevision.branchinfo`.

 * Callbacks for revlog.addgroup and the changelog._nodeduplicatecallback hook
   now get a revision number as argument instead of a node.

 * revlog.addrevision returns the revision number instead of the node.
