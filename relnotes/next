== New Features ==

 * New config `commands.commit.post-status` shows status after successful
 commit.


== New Experimental Features ==

 * New config `experimental.log.topo` makes `hg log -G` use
   topological sorting. This is especially useful for aliases since it
   lets the alias accept an `-r` option while still using topological
   sorting with or without the `-r` (unlike if you use the `sort(...,
   topo)` revset).


== Bug Fixes  ==


== Backwards Compatibility Changes ==

 * Removed (experimental) support for log graph lines mixing
   parent/grandparent styles. Setting
   e.g. `experimental.graphstyle.parent = !` and
   `experimental.graphstyle.grandparent = 3.` would use `!` for the
   first three lines of the graph and then `.`. This is no longer
   supported.

 * If `ui.origbackuppath` had been (incorrectly) configured to point
   to a file, we will now replace that file by a directory and put
   backups in that directory. This is similar to how we would
   previously replace files *in* the configured directory by
   subdirectories.

== Internal API Changes ==

 * Matchers are no longer iterable. Use `match.files()` instead.

 * `match.visitdir()` and `match.visitchildrenset()` now expect the
   empty string instead of '.' to indicate the root directory.

 * `util.dirs()` and `util.finddirs()` now include an entry for the
   root directory (empty string).
