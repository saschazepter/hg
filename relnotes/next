== New Features ==


== Default Format Change ==

These changes affects newly created repositories (or new clone) done with
Mercurial 6.1.

The `share-safe` format variant is now enabled by default. It makes
configuration and requirements more consistent across repository and their
shares. This introduces a behavior change as shares from a repository using the
new format will also use their main repository's configuration.

See `hg help config.format.use-share-safe` for details about the feature and
the available options for auto-upgrading existing shares.


== New Experimental Features ==

== Bug Fixes ==

The `--no-check` and `--no-merge` now properly overwrite the behavior from `commands.update.check`.

== Backwards Compatibility Changes ==

The remotefilelog extension now requires an appropiate excludepattern
for subrepositories.

The labels passed to merge tools have changed slightly. Merge tools can get
labels passed to them if you include `$labellocal`, `$labelbase`, and/or
`$labelother` in the `merge-tool.<tool name>.args` configuration. These labels
used to have some space-padding, and truncation to fit within 72 columns. Both
the padding and the truncation has been removed.

Some of the text in labels passed to merge tools has changed. For example,
in conflicts while running `hg histedit`, the labels used to be "local",
"base", and "histedit". They are now "already edited",
"parent of current change", and "current change", respectively.

The use of `share-safe`, means shares (of new repositories) will also use their
main repository's configuration see the `Default Format Change` section
for details.

== Internal API Changes ==

The following functions have been removed:
