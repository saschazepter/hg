== New Features ==

 * `hg purge`/`hg clean` can now delete ignored files instead of
   untracked files, with the new -i flag.

 * New `conflictlocal()` and `conflictother()` revsets returns the
   commits that are being merged, when there are conflicts. Also works
   for conflicts caused by e.g. `hg graft`.
