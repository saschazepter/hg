== New Features ==

 * There is a new config section for templates used by hg commands. It
   is called `[command-templates]`. Some existing config options have
   been deprecated in favor of config options in the new
   section. These are: `ui.logtemplate` to `command-templates.log`,
   `ui.graphnodetemplate` to `command-templates.graphnode`,
   `ui.mergemarkertemplate` to `command-templates.mergemarker`,
   `ui.pre-merge-tool-output-template` to
   `command-templates.pre-merge-tool-output`.

 * There is a new set of config options for the template used for the
   one-line commit summary displayed by various commands, such as `hg
   rebase`. The main one is `command-templates.oneline-summary`. That
   can be overridden per command with
   `command-templates.oneline-summary.<command>`, where `<command>`
   can be e.g. `rebase`. As part of this effort, the default format
   from `hg rebase` was reorganized a bit.


 * `hg strip`, from the strip extension, is now a core command, `hg
   debugstrip`. The extension remains for compatibility.
