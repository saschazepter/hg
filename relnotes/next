== New Features ==


== Default Format Change ==

These changes affects newly created repositories (or new clone) done with
Mercurial XXX.


== New Experimental Features ==

== Bug Fixes ==

The `--no-check` and `--no-merge` now properly overwrite the behavior from `commands.update.check`.

== Backwards Compatibility Changes ==

The remotefilelog extension now requires an appropiate excludepattern
for subrepositories.

The labels passed to merge tools have changed slightly. Merge tools can get
labels passed to them if you include `$labellocal`, `$labelbase`, and/or
`$labelother` in the `merge-tool.<tool name>.args` configuration. These labels
used to have some space-padding, and truncation to fit within 72 columns. Both
the padding and the truncation has been removed.

Some of the text in labels passed to merge tools has changed. For example,
in conflicts while running `hg histedit`, the labels used to be "local",
"base", and "histedit". They are now "already edited",
"parent of current change", and "current change", respectively.

== Internal API Changes ==

The following functions have been removed:
