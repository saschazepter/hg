== Bug Fixes  ==

 * The `indent()` template function was documented to not indent empty lines,
   but it still indented the first line even if it was empty. It no longer does
   that.

== Backwards Compatibility Changes ==


== Internal API Changes ==

 * Matcher instances no longer have a `explicitdir` property. Consider
   rewriting your code to use `repo.wvfs.isdir()` and/or
   `ctx.hasdir()` instead. Also, the `traversedir` property is now
   also called when only `explicitdir` used to be called. That may
   mean that you can simply remove the use of `explicitdir` if you
   were already using `traversedir`.
