== New Features ==

 * `hg mv -A` can now be used with `--at-rev`. It behaves just like
   `hg cp -A --at-rev`, i.e. it marks the destination as a copy of the
   source whether or not the source still exists (but the source must
   exist in the parent revision).

 * New revset predicate `diffcontains(pattern)` for filtering revisions
   in the same way as `hg grep --diff pattern`.


== New Experimental Features ==



== Bug Fixes ==



== Backwards Compatibility Changes ==



== Internal API Changes ==

 * `merge.update()` is now private (renamed to `_update()`). Hopefully
   the higher-level functions available in the same module cover your
   use cases.
