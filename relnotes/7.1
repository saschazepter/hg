# Mercurial 7.1 (2025-08-04)

## Mercurial 7.1.1

A scheduled minor release containing only one series that is relevant for these notes.

The series fixes the way we detect non-critical repository corruption due to issue6528 because, unfortunately, the fix for issue6528 was itself buggy.

This means that if your repo had the on-the-fly rewrite option on (which is the default), too many file revisions will have been marked as having metadata, potentially costing you a bit of performance because Mercurial will look for metadata that isn't there.

**Your repository will behave completely fine by not doing anything**, and we even have work well underway that changes how we flag file revisions with metadata, removing the root of this problem entirely.

If you want to fix this however, as with the original issue, this problem is contagious across the wire so you need to first upgrade to 7.1.1 to get the correct on-the-fly rewrite, and then run the `hg debug-repair-issue6528` command to repair your clone. Consult the help of this command for more options.

* issue6528: fix the detection of metadata from delta
* issue6528: avoid creating an intermediate bytes object
* issue6528: don't process snapshot as patches
* issue6528: fix fast path detection of file with metadata
* issue6528: don't report the revision as affect if it just has me
* issue6528: factor out the parent checking
* issue6528: stop trusting repository parent order claiming metadata ex
* issue6528: add --paranoid flag to various call
* issue6528: simplify code flow in _is_revision_affected_fast_inner
* issue6528: directly use delta_has_meta in _is_revision_affected_fast_inner

## Mercurial 7.1

This release is the first that does **not** support Python 3.8.

As always, a lot of patches don't make it to the release notes.

### New Features

* share: add a `--share-source` argument to `hg root`
* fastexport: make it possible to ignore `.gitmodules` in the source repository

Many Rust-related changes
* rust-revset: support resolving `wdir()`
* rhg: allow `--repo` as abbreviation for `--repository`
* rhg: support basic aliases
* rhg: support -0 flag in `rhg files`
* rust-annotate: support `-Tjson`
* rust-annotate: support `--rev wdir()`
* rust-annotate: allow `--follow`
* rhg: document known rough edges for the sake of users and packagers

Better profiling options, Rust tracebacks and tracing framework
* profiling: support writing profiles to a directory
* tracing: add a way of calling the Rust tracing framework from Python
* rust-errors: add support for a runtime-configured backtrace
* dispatch: enable Rust traceback processing when using `--tracing`

Improvement to debug commands
* debugcommands: bring over functionality from debugshell extension
* debugindexdot: add flags for more control over graph

Other noteworthy performance work

* `rhg annotate` is up to 61 times faster in certain pathological cases
* Improved performance of the low-level Rust storage primitive
* Removed a lot of syscalls when listing things from storage with high-level APIs
* merge: save one status in certain cases
* merge: improve detection of subrepos in Rust fast path
* Improved the delta encoding algorithm by avoiding computation, using better heuristics and folding deltas
* hgtags-fnode-cache: fast path full warm when no tag exists

Developer tooling

* setup-dev-tools: add a first version of script that install dev tools
* setup-dev-tools: add make target to format the working copy using `fix`
* setup-dev-tools: add make target to format the current stack using `fix`

### Default Format Change

No default format changes this version.

### New Experimental Features

Following last version's "update from null", this is a Rust version of the update logic when all tracked files are clean and we are not merging. It is on by default if you have Rust enabled: if you encounter any problems use `rust.update-from-clean=no` to disable it, and please let us know what the problem is.

* rust: add an "update from clean" fast-path

New flags are being added to the revlog and transmitted over the network to help with copytracing and delta encoding.

* revlog: introduce a `FLAG_FILELOG_META` revlog flag and requirements
* changegroup: use `REVIDX_HASMETA` in changegroup '04'
* revlog: add a delta-info-flag requirements
* changegroup: transmit snapshot level information in cg4
* delta-search: add a option to ignore suspicious delta

A temporary store encoding that should only exist for one version of Mercurial, until we get a better solution to a very specific problem that you probably don't have.

* store: add a first version of a "plain" encoding
* rust: add support for plain encoding

### Bug Fixes

* diff: fix function name context detection (issue6965)
* merge: filter ambiguous files and/or wait for fs tick in `applyupdates`
* rust: handle censored revisions according to the config
* changelog: also disable sparse-revlog when disabling generaldelta
* rust-repo: unconditionally load the dirstate before loading the changelog
* revlog: fix a bytes vs str crash when emitting a deprecation warning
* rust-annotate: prefix abort messages with "abort:"
* debugshell: return an exit code 1 on exception
* dirstate: properly purge the cwd cache between commands
* commandserver: always restore working directory (issue6992)
* dispatch: always chdir back in _getlocal
* dispatch: `chdir` back to original `cwd` in `_dispatch`
* ui: avoid a str interpolation into bytes crash in `fixconfig()`
* contrib-hgk: use plain ascii `(C)` instead of latin1 symbol"

### Backwards Compatibility Changes

* fastexport: add support for Git subrepositories (BC)
* pycompat: drop support for Python 3.8 (BC)
* annotate: use exit code 255 for missing files
* contrib: delete debugshell extension
* rust: update minimum Rust supported version to 1.85.1 for the 7.1 cycle

### Internal API Changes

* revlog: add "writable" parameter to revlog
* revlog: enforce that filelog get the `writable` parameter passed

### Miscellaneous

As with every release for a while, there were a ton of patches helping with adding typing information to our Python code, and catching bugs while doing so. The Pytype CI job itself was upgraded to be more helpful.

We've migrated our Rust<->Python bridge from using the deprecated `rust-cpython` to the new standard `PyO3`.

* rust: remove `hg-cpython`
* rust: move from `log` to `tracing`-based logging

We've upgraded our CI to be much easier to update, more up-to-date and use smaller images

* ci: switch the "checks" job to a "v3.0" images

Other mentions
* debugnodemap: print a message when no action was specified
* pyproject: SPDX license expression and license-files (PEP 639)
* apache-server: update the setup from Wheezy to Buster
* apache-server: update the README, add Anubis, add notes about ProxyPass
* rust-pyo3: raise proper Exceptions in more cases
* rust-dependencies: upgrade `which` dependency
* rust: move README from rst to md
* contrib: add support for rhel10
