= Mercurial 7.0rc0 =

/!\ These are the release notes for a tentative version of Mercurial, anything
/!\ and everything is subject to change.

== Packaging Changes ==

The 7.0 release is the first to be compliant with `PEP 517`.

This required an overhaul of the Mercurial packaging: packagers should pay extra
attention to this release and report any issues they might encounter with the
new system.

In practice, this means that Mercurial's `setup.py` can no longer be called
directly.
Instead, one should build the Mercurial package using PyPA's `build` package
(https://github.com/pypa/build).

In the general case, this will take care of the build dependencies, but
packagers might want to explicitly manage them. Currently the build depends on:

- `wheel`
- `setuptools>=64`
- `setuptools_scm>=8.1.0`
- `docutils`

The `Makefile` no longer offers a `build` target.
We now use `BuildTools 2022` when building Windows packages.

== Other Backwards Compatibility Changes ==

- sslutil: bump the default minimum TLS version of the client to 1.2 (BC) (085cc409847d)
- setup: require TLS 1.2 support from the Python interpreter (BC) (a820a7a1fce0)

== New Features ==

- It is now possible to store inline clone bundle outside of .hg (48572371d478)
- Added a generic `storage.all-slow-path` option to control the default
  behavior regarding degraded support for some repository format. (bbbb12632607)
- Added a `--to` flag to `hg graft` that allows graft in memory (68dc6cecca32)
- Added a `fix.extra-bin-paths` configuration for the `fix` extension (1330278b9029)

== New Experimental Features ==

- add a --ignore-changes-from-ancestors option (688665425496)
- stream-clone: use dedicated threads to write the data on disk (7f848cfc4286, 58baa86c7a02, aee193b1c784)
- the experimental `git` extension now supports more commands

== Bug Fixes ==

- subrepo: fix calling outgoing with multiple paths (85c095c1f8bc)
- stream clone: fix a race condition around volatile files (46574e588017, 3f0cf7bb3086)
- rhg: set the expected dirstate permissions (0o666 minus umask) (a48c688d3e80)
- rhg: fix matcher issue (136e74c2bf8f)
- rhg files correctly implements `--rev` (it instead provided `--revision`)
- clone-bundles: fix background spawning of automatic generation
- bundle-spec: properly format boolean parameter (issue6960)
- bundle2: fix a bug where _forwardchunks doesn't work with empty bundles

== Rust ==

- the Rust code is now exposed to Python though PyO3 instead of `rust-cpython` (6673cec8605c)¹
- rhg: support `status --change`, including `--copies` (bde718849153)
- Rust implementation for the internal part of revlogs
- Rust implementation for `hg annotate` (6183949219b2)
- Rust implementation for `hg update` from a completely empty working copy

[1] Both `rust-cpython` and `PyO3` bridges are present in this release in case users need to switch back (by changing every `importrust` call) in case something went really wrong in the translation. The `rust-cpython` code will be removed entirely in Mercurial 7.1.

== Miscellaneous ==

- help: modernize the help text for `hostsecurity.minimumprotocol` (b65085c6d6ff)
- run-tests: add a 4th `HGPORT` value (7f8d0c2c3692)
- rust-ignore: make `debugignorerhg` command show a full regex, with exact files (e2e49069eeb6)
- tests: fix `filtertraceback.py` to handle contiguous `File` lines (8431296a93e8)
- typing: moved `interface` logic from `zope` interfaces to `typing.Protocol` (a1c0f19e7cb4)
- format: add pattern filtering to debugformat (8dede0df9de9)
- run-tests: add a `--tail-report` argument to analyze run parallelism (a814534aaedd)
