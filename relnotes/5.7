== New Features ==

 * There is a new config section for templates used by hg commands. It
   is called `[command-templates]`. Some existing config options have
   been deprecated in favor of config options in the new
   section. These are: `ui.logtemplate` to `command-templates.log`,
   `ui.graphnodetemplate` to `command-templates.graphnode`,
   `ui.mergemarkertemplate` to `command-templates.mergemarker`,
   `ui.pre-merge-tool-output-template` to
   `command-templates.pre-merge-tool-output`.

 * There is a new set of config options for the template used for the
   one-line commit summary displayed by various commands, such as `hg
   rebase`. The main one is `command-templates.oneline-summary`. That
   can be overridden per command with
   `command-templates.oneline-summary.<command>`, where `<command>`
   can be e.g. `rebase`. As part of this effort, the default format
   from `hg rebase` was reorganized a bit.

 * `hg purge` is now a core command using `--confirm` by default.

 * `hg diff` and `hg extdiff` now support `--from <rev>` and `--to <rev>`
   arguments as clearer alternatives to `-r <revs>`. `-r <revs>` has been
   deprecated.

 * The memory footprint per changeset during pull/unbundle
   operations has been further reduced.

 * There is a new internal merge tool called `internal:mergediff` (can
   be set as the value for the `merge` config in the `[ui]`
   section). It resolves merges the same was as `internal:merge` and
   `internal:merge3`, but it shows conflicts differently. Instead of
   showing 2 or 3 snapshots of the conflicting pieces of code, it
   shows one snapshot and a diff. This may be useful when at least one
   side of the conflict is similar to the base. The new marker style
   is also supported by "premerge" as
   `merge-tools.<tool>.premerge=keep-mergediff`.

 * External hooks are now called with `HGPLAIN=1` preset.  This has the side
   effect of ignoring aliases, templates, revsetaliases, and a few other config
   options in any `hg` command spawned by the hook.  The previous behavior
   can be restored by setting HGPLAINEXCEPT appropriately in the parent process.
   See `hg help environment` for the list of items, and how to set it.

 * The `branchmap` cache is updated more intelligently and can be
   significantly faster for repositories with many branches and changesets.

 * The `rev-branch-cache` is now updated incrementally whenever changesets
   are added.


== New Experimental Features ==

* `experimental.single-head-per-branch:public-changes-only` can be used
  restrict the single head check to public revision. This is useful for
  overlay repository that have both a publishing and non-publishing view
  of the same storage.


== Bug Fixes ==



== Backwards Compatibility Changes ==

 * `--force-lock` and `--force-wlock` options on `hg debuglock` command are
   renamed to `--force-free-lock` and `--force-free-wlock` respectively.


== Internal API Changes ==

 * `changelog.branchinfo` is deprecated and will be removed after 5.8.
   It is superseded by `changelogrevision.branchinfo`.
